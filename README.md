# Pacman
Pacman game using C++

The objective of the game is to eat all of the dots placed in the maze while
avoiding the ghost. Eating a dot increases your score by 1. The game is played
in two types:
1) Finishing the game by eating all the dots and having as low score as
possible. This shows how consistent and concentrated you are in eating the
dots and also tackling the ghost at the same time.
2) Score as high as possible. This only includes eating the dots and tackling
the ghost.

There are two following ways in which the game should end:
1) If you eat all the dots successfully.
2) If you get caught by the ghost.
